Not to mention i only get two to three songs Before Im bombarded with ads. Also The 30 Minutes of ad free music just doesn't work. I dont know why its not like Pc or console where you can choose and skip and rewind but with ads. The formula to make it better is there just make it the same as pc and console,4

00b60117-cad2-4091-8478-c361a59d358f,Shuffle and smart shuffle do not shuffle songs in playlists properly - the same set of songs will play in the exact same order in which they played the last time the app was open. This has been a long-standing issue. Smart shuffle also completely omits any local files that are added to a playlist.

877175ef-4e53-4515-aa10-9798293355ac,"Spotify is basically a ""Pay to use"" app now. They removed the 1week premium sell, and they've made it impossible to use the student premium. The offer isn't available for MY school, which is frustrating because I'm a student. Spotify, if you don't want people to use your app because they don't pay, just make the app for sale on the app store at this point because this is getting ridiculous. it's both frustrating and disappointing. I hope the management takes my review seriously.",2

5a0bc26a-c557-47bf-8bfe-9de743f4e6f3,this app is a waste of time Even though I don't like ads but it make sense got to make money somehow but the reason why I'm giving this app 1 star after 2 months of use is the fact that the whole time I had it 90% of the time I couldn't even listen to the songs I wanted I was forced to listen to other songs in it's playlist even though I only wanted 1/2 specific songs out of the whole list but because you're not paying a premium sub you have to hope your luck is high to listen to a song you want,1

I did expect the app to still play music w/o directly being on it. I had problems with it just to STAY playing songs w/o being on the app. It automatically stops playing the music and my notification of the song still playing disappears.

Now everything I search for and every playlist they suggest is just the same songs I listen to all the time and songs I already have saved.

Really terrible experience with it other apps are way better in terms of this. I mean it's okay that you give ads and don't allow certain things like playlist to non premium users but atleast let them listen whichever song or podcast they want without any limit.

It doesn't let you listen to what you want, there's a monthly limit on showing lyrics, and can't skip more then 6 songs per hour and askes you pay to get rid of the limits! You're better off using yt music since at least they let you pick your own songs, shows lyrics, and can skip as many songs you want. Ridiculous on how Spotify does this! One star until it improves and has less restrictions.",1

The fact that their free version cannot let users pause music, or fast forward, or skip to the next song (you get 6 skips per hour) says a lot to buttress that point. Premium has all the good stuffs, downloading offline, no ad interruption and whatnot. But premium isn't costly, so I'll let Spotify off with 4 stars. They seem to have packages for students too, so don't worry and just go for it, it's dirt cheap.",4

One thing that makes me a little crazy is the app will have an ad and then say enjoy the next 30 minutes ad free and that usually lasts 1 song, sometimes 3, but recently never the total 30 minutes. Also tends to play the same songs over and over. Yes they are on my favorites but there are about a dozen that get played excessively and doesn't play others on",4

Spotify isn't great in that regard, but it's better than most of the rest of the pack.",5

I have to restart the song sometimes twice in order for it to play the full song when I use the app on my Roku TV, but the app works perfectly fine from my phone and my Xumo box. I had family over and we were listening to music and singing and they were shocked because they had never experienced this before either. Is anyone else experiencing this where Spotify skips through songs?",1
