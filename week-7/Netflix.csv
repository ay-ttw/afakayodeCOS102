The content doesn't offer alot of new items and netflix originals are using cheaper actors that are unheard of. You dont raise costs because you lose viewers. Apple tv is only 9.99 a month I'm discontinuing services before it renews and before they raise prices yet again. I am absolutely disgusted with netflix after 7 years of being a loyal customer!,1

Like for jjk they only offer 1 season. and the worst thing is that they have enough money to license all the seasons.

75e6a339-29a2-4099-a9de-fe30b72c26f5,Chile the increases are insane. 17.99! then they don't offer an incentive for being a long time customer. Then I'm trying to change my plan to ads they want a payment before I do it. No ma'am makes no sense. Come on Netflix the increases gone have people getting HULU or Philo because 17.99 closer to almost 25.00. Give more incentives for being a customer and offer a grace period of maybe 2 weeks only,2

You have to clear cache and storage and reboot the phone before opening the app twice to get it to work.

But the audio works just black screen. The trailers screen and audio works fine tho? Also my tubi and prime video are having the same issue with like 5 movies on each of them. I've tried updating I've tried support. I have no clue and I've stopped paying my Netflix there's no point anymore,1

Also, their Customer Service is sadly lacking good quality. I have been trying to reach Customer Service for about 30 minutes and all that I am getting is a ringing phone and then disconnection. This is frustrating for a customer who pays $35 a month for the service. Quite frankly, I am actually beginning to think of leaving, the value is not the same as I first signed up.",3
