cfce5d8b-f82e-4ff8-bd6b-365d1463a813,Had Viber backup will fill my Google Drive with 800 MB and I got to 94% quota of 15 GB! It is not easy to find in Google but Viber support knew where the setting is. Go to the Drive and settings icon in the top right part of the page. There you can change app settings and delete Viber invisible data. Still it would be great if size stored on Google could be truncated from the Viber app.,5

9bf481fb-b871-4445-b83b-3c06387ac7c0,Viber sometimes does not send text messages(e.g. I send a text message from the notification bar and the text never goes to the other person) and also notifications do not appear some times(e.g. when I get a call or videocall or a photo message I do not receive a notification always). Other times does not let you answer viber calls like you answer and nothing happens when Instagram at the same time does let you(so it's not a connection problem). Fix it please.,2

This alters the URL, causing it to become invalid and leading to a 404 error[1]. To address this, you can try implementing a URL redirect using a 301 redirect to the correct page[2]. Additionally, ensure that the URLs are correctly formatted and not blocked by any security setting",2

So many garbage ""features"" that just make the user's experience bad, but one of their latest moronic updates finally made me rate it. When an unknown number messages you, the message is blurred and you initially have the option to report it as spam. For some idiotic reason, there's no option to first read the message to confirm it's spam and THEN report. Once you get rid of the option to report it, it's gone forever",1

Ads on freeware is fine but getting NOTIFICATIONS for ads is another low. [Reply to the developers]: The ability to send a request is not a satisfactory solution to the problem. There is no guarantee my request is going to get approved and I shouldnt have received promotional messages IN A MESSAGING APP. If you decide to be that cheap at least make optiong out possible as an app setting,1

e1a6b31f-c4a7-4859-af62-875e1fe3a770,Since recent updates in the last few month the call list on the different devices is a big mess. People calling within a group the device where you pick it up fine but all other devices shows as a separate call from the caller (not within the group) and the time stamp on the call is the time when the device connects to the server. So maybe days later it shows that you have a missed call just now from somebody who called days before and you received the call. And all devices shows as missed call.,2
