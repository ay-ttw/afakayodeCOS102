It needs a means of locking your profile from being invited to groups and chats. Poor performance on my phone.

d4c26ecf-2517-4f67-93ff-832d7d32ded0,Constantly suffers graphic glitches. Freezes fails to update conversations requiring it to be restarted constantly. Only the bottom portion of the screen is usable. I've installed this on two brand new pixel phones and had nothing but trouble on both of them. Even after reinstallings and updating no success. Skype hasn't really gone downhill. As is typical with all Microsoft products as soon as it is purchased it goes straight downhill.,2

The only issue with it is that fellow colleagues have had their accounts hacked, and support has not helped them recover it, and have consequently blocked them from creating a new Skype account. Another issue is that when you block someone, they can still see your posts aconversations, and I can still see there's. this needs to be addressed. as what's the point in blocking someone when they cancan stillmment on things you post.",3

Also, freezing and not letting calls through. 11.01.2024 Update 2 of the Skype apps are glitching, freezing, not notifying of calls/messages, either updating w/o my permission or not updating my status when I update my status. Not good for an app to be failing the way it is when it used to be the ultimate in face time before FaceTime.",1

Then takes another 10 - 15 seconds to open a chat. Then takes another 10 - 15 seconds to open the keyboard. On top of visual glitches where the messages are cut off briefly after closing the keyboard. And certain words don't appear to fit properly causing the last letter to get moved to a second line.

The worst is using emoticons, it's a nightmare of lagging and waiting for things to load. I wish the issues stopped there, but they don't. I can only assume the developers don't actually use the Skype app on a daily basis. It's really awful guys.",1

It now leaves my phone screen on which makes my phone hot. Their definitely needs to be a change. Not only that, but it will log me out several times on its own. i really would like to use this app comfortably, but at this time it has been annoying. Please work on the next update carefully, and consider using other users complaints to help you out.",2

808b7dea-67c6-4a2a-9314-c5ebcab53954,Multiple problems As a user of an international Skype number and other subscriptions: 1. Sometimes the calling party can't hear a word I say. Other apps - no problem with mic or anything 2. Going into the keypad to dial a number is an absolute PAIN. Each number typed triggers what looks like a synchronous call to update the suggested contact list. Having a contact list with some hundreds makes this process TERRIBLY PAINFUL. 3. Skype switches between loud speaker and the earpiece speaker randomly,1

I keep receiving fraudulent messages and being added to scammers ' chats, where unknown individuals are looking for money and information to steal. Also, once you start a subscription of any sort is nearly impossible to cancel it. Whoever is in charge at Skype by now is making the business collapsing 'till it will be forever gone. As soon as I can find a way to delete my subscription I will delete my account, the app and I will forget about it. Cheers",1

1fa10b30-5b5b-4743-afd5-3948ab11d1f6,Skype is broken. First off it wrongly identified me a human as a bot. Second it constantly logs off changing my visual settings. Third it pops up a large box obscuring my text that I have to navigate away from what I am reading and scroll up and down in increasing increments that I barely have enough room to click text to do so. Its call quality constantly makes me ask what the caller on the other side said. Its latency during calls causes either party to talk the other callers conversation,1

It is really frustrating. It tried putting my caller ID on, and it keeps telling me to get a US number. It is so disappointing.",1

Sometimes it just repeats to itself and will continue until you turn off the microphone. If one turns the microphone off and the other speaks and waits then the other speaks while your mic is off it doesn't do it . It is aggravating to have a conversation like this.
